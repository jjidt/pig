A console dice game written in Ruby

###Instructions

to use, download zip file, navigate to the lib directory and open pig.rb in ruby

###Rules

Pig is a two player game where players take turns rolling a pair of dice.  If the value of either die is 1, it is the next players turn, and the rolling player gets a 0 for that round.
If a player doesn't roll a 1, they will have the option of rolling again to accumulate a higher round score
or passing to the other player and adding their current round score to their point total.  The first player to reach 100 points wins.
